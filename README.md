# OOP-and-Data-Structures-Album-Store
A simple program that uses Object Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
The program creates an album store where customers can rent albums from its current inventory.
The program reads external files to: 
	create a hash table of customers,
	create a binary search tree of albums,
	process commands to display: the whole inventory, cutomers' transactions history, borrows, returns.
The program does not use python's dictionary as the hash table. The binary search tree and hash table were implemented.
